# Network-Traffic-Analysis-of-Android-apps-using-MITMproxy-and-Frida
Abstract: With the overwhelmingly increasing number of applications in android marketplace, i.e., google play store; over time with the development of android operating system and user experience; the aspect of vulnerability has risen constantly. Over time, as applications have been developed along with android OS to keep up the pace, security concerns have risen. And in this era of the internet, most of the threats pose from there. In our daily lives almost every app is dependent on the internet. My analysis focuses on the part of android applications where they make connections to different web and third-party servers through the internet during performing any specific or common tasks. The android framework architecture diagram (Figure 1); would be appropriate to provide an overall explanation of my target. I will be taking advantage of the runtime layer to monitor API calls made by android apps within the android framework layer. This analytical report contains detailed statistics about how concerning unauthorized data transfer can be.
